Graph notes :
Graph is made of two components :
1-->vertex /node,
2-->edge

Graph is of two types :
1--> undirected graph : here the edges between two graph is not directed we can say the edge betwwn u and v also v and u also given u and v are nodes of graph.
2--> directed graph : here the edges between two graph is directed we can say the edge betwwn u and v but not edge between v and u because a specific direction is given between
edges of graph.

Degree: the no of edges are connected to a node in undirected graph . 
in undirected graph the total no of degree in all the nodes is equal to the == 2 * no of edges in the graph.

Graph notes :
Graph is made of two components :
1-->vertex /node,
2-->edge

Graph is of two types :
1--> undirected graph : here the edges between two graph is not directed we can say the edge betwwn u and v also v and u also given u and v are nodes of graph.
2--> directed graph : here the edges between two graph is directed we can say the edge betwwn u and v but not edge between v and u because a specific direction is given between
edges of graph.

Degree: the no of edges are connected to a node in undirected graph . 
in undirected graph the total no of degree in all the nodes is equal to the == 2 * no of edges in the graph.

The total degree of all the nodes in an undirected graph is twice the no of edges in the graph.
D=2*TOTAL NO OF EDGES.

In case of directed graph there is incoming edge and outgoing edge for a particular node so there is 2 types of degree
1)INDEGREE :- it means the total no of edges coming toward a node.
2)OUTDEGREE :- it means the total no of edges going away from node.

Path : In undirected graph path means moving from one node to another but you cant go back to same node.
    ex : 1,2,3 or 1,2 but not 1,2,3,2.
    
       Since in directed graph there is specific direction is already present so we can not go anywhere but to follow that path.
